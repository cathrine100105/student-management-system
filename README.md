 ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
 Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing student data

 Data Structure
 Each student is represented as an object with the following attributes:
 id: Integer (unique student ID)
 name: String (full name)
 age: Integer (age of the student)

 Students are stored in a dynamic in-memory data structure:
 Type: List
 Implementation: ArrayList
